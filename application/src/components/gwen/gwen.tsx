				<p>
					My passion for software development was basically originating from the will to
					create video games. Due to economic and safety reasons, I discarded the thought
					of starting a career as a game developer before my studies and decided to make it a hobby.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is why and how my first game engineering project started. Currently, it's called
					GWEN (Game without extra-ordinary name). It is developed using the awesome Godot Game Engine,
					and shall become an MMORPG, based on inspiration by games like World of Warcraft,
					Lord of the Rings Online, ARK, Minecraft and some others that I used to play in my spare time.

					The project itself is work in progress, screenshots and material may follow.
				</p>

				<p>
					In parallel, I try to build a Godot-dedicated library based on common
					software design patterns that have become established over the last years.
