At the end of my integrated degree program I signed a contract to continue working for Serviceware SE.

My first business project was exciting: I was set up to travel back and forth to the dutch site of the company, starting as a full stack developer in the dutch team. There, I was developing web frontends with angular.js and REST APIs written in ASP.NET.
Furthermore I brought in my expertise on how to set up modern continuous integration pipelines with Microsoft Team Foundation Server.

After 1.5 years, I turned back to the site in Hürth and joined the UX Team, which was mainly responsible for developing the client products of the system. Things I have done there:

- a migration of a consumer portal to angular.js and a modern architecture
- a brand-new mobile app, written in angular.js and ported with Apache Cordova
- Cross-Platform development with Cordova & Electron
- Working abroad for 50% at the Dutch site of the company
- Integration of two fully independent but complementing systems to build an end-to-end use case. Implemented using WCF and SignalR
- Implement a Mobile Hybrid App using Capacitor/Cordova, offering push notifications and native device integration
- Extend Rich Client written in WPF by various features
- Mobile App Development for Android (native SDK) and iOS (Xamarin for iOS)
