At Trusted Shops, I officially started as a frontend developer only. I started as a part of their Consumer UX Team, being responsible for the consumer web frontend. During the time in this team, I deep-dived into Angular 2 and all further versions released - learning and expanding my knowledge about the framework.

After working on the consumer platform, I continued to work on a website relaunch, based on Wordpress and Angular.
As this was finished, I was part of rebuilding a new satellite of the Website with Angular - but this time, in combination with Angular Universal and SEO optimizations.

Since I also wanted to bring in my infrastructure and backend skills, I implemented a modular and pluggable test environment created with docker.

Last but not least, I have been full-stack developer responsible for building a pluggable micro-frontend platform and reusable libraries together with my current team. This also included consultation and helping to design core services like permissions, notifications and external oauth administration.
