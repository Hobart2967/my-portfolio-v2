My apprenticeship was shortened by 6 months and sucessfully finished, so I continued to work in the company as a working student.
There, I continued to work as a software engineer in the Research and Development division.

In that time I was responsible for developing a communication interface between two of our systems developed in-house.
In the product developed in Hürth, I managed the contracts and APIs for migrating data from/to the systems together with the team that was working on the second product.
