In my private spare time after school, I was working on my PC very often. Exchanging parts, upgrading the system and modifying it was much fun to me. To also earn some money and increasing my pocket money while still going to school, I applied to Grey Computer Cologne.

This company was one of the biggest computer stores close to my living town. It also had a manufacturing garage attached, where they still needed some help. This is where I came into play:

I was working there, building PCs of different configurations. Water Coolings, super silent office PCs or extreme gaming machines - These are all builds that I have worked on there.
