After finishing my graduation at a german Gymnasium, I applied for studying in an integrated degree program. That means, I was doing the studies and my apprenticeship at the same time. This is why it is also called `Dual Degree` (literally translated) in German.

I joined the Serviceware SE, formerly called `helpLine rd GmbH` or `PMCS.helpLine Software Group` in the location in Hürth.

Starting off from the quality assurance department, I got tought how testing works from A-Z. Because of a missing automation in reportings, the QA team was also responsible for the daily reports of bugs and fixes - There I had my first projects creating an automation for it.
Furthermore, I picked up topics like improving continuous integration pipelines with Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
For the QA Team, I also created Test Plans and learned how tests are organized professionally.

After that, I was planning my first IT-System for Software-Development: It was a test lab, a multi-server environment connected to Microsoft Test Manager.

Then I switched over to the development department: Here I was a part of the development of applications like Rich-Clients, WebApps, and Server-Side environments. Since it was company relying on Microsoft products, we 90% used C# as Coding language.

Here a summary of the main projects I have been working on:

- Introduce a on-demand testing environment using MS TFS, MS VMM and MS Test Manager
- Integration of two fully independent but complementing systems to build an end-to-end use case. Implemented using WCF and SignalR
- Improve the ASP.NET Web Application by different customer desires
Single-Page Application development using angular.js
- Create a fully automated reporting system aggregating weekly software release progress data
- Crystal Reports templating
- Different system setups and templating, including Windows Server Systems with required services (IIS, MSMQ, etc)
