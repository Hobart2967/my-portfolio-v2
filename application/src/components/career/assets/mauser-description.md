During my time in school we were advised to do a second training on a profession we prefer to learn in the future. I decided to join the Mauser Group IT department.

Here, I learned how software development could be useful when planning resources, adjusting infrastructures and many more. In addition, I was experiencing how colleagues problems are solved and what a fire-protection in a server rack looks like.

Furthermore, I learned alot of things about what different roles there are in such a department and why they are important.
