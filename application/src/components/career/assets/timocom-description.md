At TIMOCOM, I was assigned to the team being responsible for developing operational security but also monitoring security services for the company.

This meant that the team was mainly responsible for hosting a Keycloak. I have mainly been working on these topics:

- Implement, maintain and observe multiple features within Java SpringBoot Services and Keycloak SPIs
- Maintain and extend the service cluster infrastructure (Deployments and Stateful Sets) within kubernetes.
- Improve and stabilize Gitlab Pipelines
